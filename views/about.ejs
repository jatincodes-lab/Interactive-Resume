        <h1>My Story</h1>
        <h3>
          I am a passionate web developer with a background in computer science.
          My journey began in the field of programming when I stumbled upon an
          opportunity to create interactive websites. I have always been
          fascinated by technology and its potential to transform the way people
          interact with the world. I have worked on various projects, from small
          side projects to large-scale projects, showcasing my ability to create
          visually appealing and functional websites. My current focus is on
          developing cutting-edge web applications using modern technologies
          like React and Node.js. I am currently available for freelance work or
          collaborations on projects that align with my skills and interests.
